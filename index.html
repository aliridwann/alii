	<p>I work for Bangladesh's garment industry. This industry generates $34 billion in revenue annually and it is a sector that accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh's total export earnings.

Hi! I'm Ali and I am passionately curious about all the new things!
I am currently working for Sadma Group. It is a composite Garments site. It is my first full-time job. I am pretty excited to work for an industry which makes the country the second-largest exporter of garments in the world
My initial responsibility was to take follow-ups of production lines. During these follow-ups, a number of problems that resulted in poor production came into light and had been sorted out as soon as it was addressed by the IE or the Management.
After a few months, I was assigned to one of the big projects which were to integrate they're all of the sister concerns into one ERP system. The ERP system consists of 4 modules. Material Management, Accounts & Finance, HR & Production Management

I started off taking charge of Material Management. To complete this process, I had collected the 2-year data of the company. I have started working with around 25,000 Articles and 6,000+ Materials. I've grown my skills in full-cycle Requisition, Checking, Approval, Procurement, Gate Entry, Goods Received Notes(GRN) & Inventory Issue. The Material Management Module has been live and it's running in 5 stores of 3 sister companies of Sadma Group and resulting in a very friendly and approachable process. As for Management, they can also view all types of reports which are being generated from the ERP system in a more convenient way.

Working with a fast-paced garments industry has taught me how to be more effective and efficient. It also made me open to a wide range of people. Giving them the training of ERP software to make them persuade about the system of software was itself a challenging journey for me.
I, at present, working for the Accounts & Order Management Module.<br> <br> <br> <br> 

Currently, I am learning CODING!!!
